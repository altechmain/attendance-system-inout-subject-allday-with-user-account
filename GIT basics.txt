Step-by-Step Guide
1. Open VS Code and Terminal
Open your project folder in VS Code.
Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + or go to View > Terminal).
2. Check Git Remote
Make sure your local repo is connected to GitHub:


You should see something like:

origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (push)
3. Fetch Latest Changes

git fetch origin

4. Reset Your Local Code to Match GitHub
‚ö†Ô∏è This will overwrite your local changes. Make sure you‚Äôve backed up anything important.


git reset --hard origin/main


Replace main with your branch name if it's different (e.g., master, dev, etc.).

5. Clean Up Untracked Files (Optional)
If you want to remove files that aren‚Äôt tracked by Git:


git clean -fd

üõë Important Notes
This process overwrites your local files with the latest version from GitHub.
If you have local changes you want to keep, consider committing or stashing them first:


git stash
